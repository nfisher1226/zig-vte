/// The GtkFixed widget is a container which can place child widgets at fixed
/// positions and with fixed sizes, given in pixels. GtkFixed performs no
/// automatic layout management.
///
/// For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps you from
/// having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it results in broken
/// applications. With GtkFixed, the following things will result in truncated
/// text, overlapping widgets, and other display bugs:
/// * Themes, which may change widget sizes.
/// * Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
/// * Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also, display of non-English text will use a different font in many cases.
/// In addition, GtkFixed does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
/// produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
/// such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK+ will order containers
/// appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
/// thing they label when using an RTL language, but it canâ€™t do that with
/// GtkFixed. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
/// you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.
///
/// Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove GUI
/// elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This is a
/// long-term maintenance problem for your application.
///
/// If you know none of these things are an issue for your application, and
/// prefer the simplicity of GtkFixed, by all means use the widget. But you
/// should be aware of the tradeoffs.
///
/// See also GtkLayout, which shares the ability to perform fixed positioning
/// of child widgets and additionally adds custom drawing and scrollability.
